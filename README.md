# arduino-minimp3

Minimalistic, single-header library for decoding MP3. minimp3 is designed to be
small, fast (with SSE and NEON support), and accurate (ISO conformant). Further information can be found in the [oringal readme](README.original).

I have extended the project so that it can be used as Arduino library.

### Installation in Arduino

You can download the library as zip and call include Library -> zip library. Or you can git clone this project into the Arduino libraries folder e.g. with

```
cd  ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries
git clone pschatzmann/arduino-minimp3.git
```

I recommend to use git because you can easily update to the latest version just by executing the ```git pull``` command in the project folder.
